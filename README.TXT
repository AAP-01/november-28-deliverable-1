Welcome to the recipe book, made by Daniel and John for the Programming 1 LIA project.

This uses Scanners, so you'll type inputs in the terminal to navigate the recipe book. Initiate 
void main(String[] args) to start the program, or alternatively initiate objects in the diagram 
to create recipes and navigate the recipe book manually.
