Welcome to the recipe book, made by Daniel and John for the Programming 1 LIA project.

This uses Scanners, so you'll type inputs in the terminal to navigate the recipe book. Initiate 
void main(String[] args) to start the program, or alternatively initiate objects in the diagram 
to create recipes and navigate the recipe book manually.

Starting the program will display the "cover page" of the recipe book and the menu. There are 
4 options which include creating a new recipe, listing all registered recipes, opening a specific 
recipe, and closing the book (ending the program).

A recipe contains its name, type (DISH, DRINK or DESERT), specific characteristics (vegetarian, 
alcoholic, hot, or frozen), ingredients, and the instructions (also called steps).

When creating a recipe, the program will ask for the recipe's type, an ingredient's name, 
quantity type, amount, and other characteristics based on the recipe's type. The user can add 
more ingredients or move to instructions by typing "done". As many steps can be added as the 
user desires. typing "done" finalizes the recipe and creates a txt file using the provided 
information. Each information type is distinguised by a special character at the start of each 
line. 

Final thoughts
(John) I may not have done the bulk of the program and I may not have understood the specifics, 
but I learned a lot on how real programs function and techniques to apply while reading through 
the code. Our recipe book is fairly unique by how the user can personalize recipes and that 
everything runs in the terminal. It's additionally scalable in the sense that the program 
doesn't have a limit in terms of how many recipes there are due to using ArrayLists. Overall, 
I thought that this was pretty good at applying learned concepts onto the practical side of 
programming without the restrictions in the labs.
